# Booki - A demo website

Booki is a single-page website created from three figma mockups. I made it for the first project of the OpenClassrooms training that I am currently entitled: Application Developer - Javascript React.

Made in desktop first, it was a real challenge, but very instructive.

You can visit it at the [github page](https://empostigo.github.io/Booki/)

Btw, I'm not the author of the models.
